Timely and accurate identification of these pests is crucial for effective pest management strategies. In this project, titled \"Agricultural Pests Classification: ResNet-50 V2,\" we aim to develop a robust machine learning model capable of classifying various agricultural pests using advanced deep learning techniques. This project leverages the power of the ResNet-50 V2 architecture, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its exceptional performance in image classification tasks.\n\nThe dataset utilized for this classification task comprises two primary components: the Agricultural Pests Dataset and the Agricultural Pests Image Dataset. These datasets contain a diverse collection of images of agricultural pests along with their corresponding labels. The images are sourced from various agricultural settings, ensuring a comprehensive representation of different pest species.\n\n## Datasets\n### Agricultural Pests Dataset:\n\nThis dataset contains a CSV file with essential information regarding the training and test images. Each entry provides a filename corresponding to an image and its associated label, indicating the type of pest present in the image. The dataset is structured to facilitate the loading and processing of images for training the classification model.\nThe dataset can be accessed at the following link: Agricultural Pests Dataset.\nAgricultural Pests Image Dataset:\n\nAccompanying the main dataset, this dataset contains the actual images used for training and testing. The images are organized in a manner that reflects the classes they belong to, ensuring ease of access during the data preprocessing and model training phases.\nThe dataset can be accessed at the following link: Agricultural Pests Image Dataset.\nResNet-50 V2 Agricultural Pests Classification:\n\nFor this project, we have adopted the ResNet-50 V2 model, a deep learning architecture renowned for its residual learning framework. This model allows for the training of very deep networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem, making it particularly effective for complex image classification tasks.\nThe model is pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet) and fine-tuned on our specific dataset of agricultural pests. The adaptability of the ResNet-50 V2 architecture enables it to capture intricate features of pest images, leading to improved classification accuracy.\n\n## Model Utilization\nThe ResNet-50 V2 model is implemented using the Lobe library, which simplifies the process of training and deploying machine learning models. The Lobe library allows us to load the pre-trained model and fine-tune it using our dataset, streamlining the training process. Once the model is trained, it is capable of predicting the presence of specific agricultural pests in unseen images, providing valuable insights for pest management in agricultural practices.\n\nIn summary, this project showcases the integration of deep learning techniques with agricultural pest classification, demonstrating the potential of technology to enhance pest management strategies. Through this notebook, we will explore the various stages of data preparation, model training, and evaluation, ultimately aiming to contribute to the ongoing efforts in sustainable agriculture.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\ntrain=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-dataset/train.csv')\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-14T08:39:28.218880Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-14T08:39:28.219312Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-14T08:39:28.315975Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-14T08:39:28.219271Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-14T08:39:28.314693Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"execution_count":1,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                            filename        label\n0  /kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...        snail\n1  /kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...         wasp\n2  /kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...         bees\n3  /kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...  grasshopper\n4  /kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...       weevil","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>filename</th>\n      <th>label</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...</td>\n      <td>snail</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...</td>\n      <td>wasp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...</td>\n      <td>bees</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...</td>\n      <td>grasshopper</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>/kaggle/input/agricultural-pests-image-dataset...</td>\n      <td>weevil</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## we are importing the necessary library and loading the training data from a CSV file.\n\n* Importing pandas:\npandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python.

This class is specifically designed for image classification tasks and provides methods for loading pre-trained models, making predictions, and evaluating performance. It simplifies the workflow for image-related machine learning projects.\n\n* Loading the Pre-trained Model: The load method of the ImageModel class is invoked to load a pre-trained model from a specified path. This model is expected to be based on the ResNet-50 V2 architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network known for its ability to capture complex patterns in image data.\n\n* Model Object: The model object is referenced at the end of the cell, which displays the model’s architecture, configuration, and possibly its training history. Once loaded, this model can be used to make predictions on new images and evaluate its performance on test datasets.\n\n* Importance of the ResNet-50 V2 Architecture: ResNet-50 V2 utilizes residual learning to help train very deep networks, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and allowing for better performance on complex tasks like image classification. Using a pre-trained model like ResNet-50 V2 can significantly speed up the training process and improve accuracy, especially when the available training data is limited.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis cell initializes the model for your agricultural pests classification project, leveraging the capabilities of the Lobe library and the strengths of the ResNet-50 V2 architecture to provide a solid foundation for further predictions and analyses.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result=[]\nfor i in test.filename:\n    result_i= model.predict_from_file(i)\n    result.append(result_i.prediction)\nresult[:5]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-14T08:42:42.590814Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-14T08:42:42.591146Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-14T08:44:29.027001Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-14T08:42:42.591115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-14T08:44:29.025644Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"execution_count":7,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['wasp', 'snail', 'catterpillar', 'weevil', 'beetle']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## In this cell, predictions are made for the test images using the pre-trained model.\n\n* Result Initialization: An empty list called result is created to store predictions.\n\n* Predicting for Each Image: A for loop iterates through the test.filename list, which contains the paths to the test images.
